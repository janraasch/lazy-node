> non-blocking I/O?

## Requirements

Only Node.js `>=v4.2.1`.

## Installation

Clone the repo. Cd into it and run `npm i`.

## Getting your awe inspired

Start the server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

Then open up a few more consoles and run `curl localhost:8000` all over the place. Notice how requests are accepted by the server instantly (by it printing `${n}: Request numero ${n} just came in.` to stdout) even though the requests are only answered three seconds after they have been triggered. You can also try running

```bash
ab -n 100 -c 100 http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

and have look at what your server is doing, when it gets hit by 100 requests in parallel.

Sample output of running the above ApacheBench command:

Now, if you want to dive into this a little deeper, start by watching the [Introduction to Node.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_B4LTHi3I) by Ryan Dahl or open up the `slow-but-responsive.js` file and make that little server a little more complex.
